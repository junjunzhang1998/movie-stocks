# Conclusion
Overall, this project suggests that COVID hit the movie industry especially hard and that it hasn’t recovered the way other industries have. Box office revenue, the number of theatrical releases, and the number of AMC theaters are all lower than before the pandemic, and when we zoom out to stocks, the movie index has only grown about 1.7× since 2019 while many sectors, especially tech, have roughly doubled or more. One possible reason for this gap is that AI has boosted tech a lot while also changing how images, video, and even scripts are created, which reshapes how movies are made and who gets to make them. Moreover, when we look inside the industry, we see that different types of firms follow very different paths. For example, streamers did very well during COVID, while theaters stayed the most volatile and struggled the most. However, this is still a rough picture because many companies spans across multiple segments. There are also some data limitations: we only see a small number of publicly traded firms in each sub-industry, and it’s very hard and time-consuming to build a clean, comparable panel data of streaming revenues for each company. A natural next step, if time and data allowed, would be to link these stock patterns more directly to company-level streaming and theatrical revenues to see how market performance lines up with business fundamentals.
