# Conclusion
Overall, our analysis shows that the movie industry has not recovered at the same pace as many other sectors since COVID-19. Box office revenue, the number of theatrical releases, and the number of AMC theaters are all lower than pre-pandemic levels. Stock performance tells a similar story: the movie index has only grown about 1.7× since 2019 while many sectors, especially tech, have doubled or more. One possible reason for this gap is that AI has boosted tech stock growth while also reshaping parts of the movie production pipeline, from animation to scriptwriting. The movie industry may be still adapting to this change and therefore lags behind other sectors. Within the movie industry, we see that different types of firms follow very different paths. For example, streamers did very well during COVID, while theater companies remained the most volatile and struggled the most. However, this is only a preliminary view and should be interpreted with caution given data limitations in this project, since there are only a small number of publicly traded firms in each sub-industry. We assumed that streaming might be the main direction for the industry and thought about building a dataset with different types of revenue for each company to see how streaming changed over time. But this turned out to be very time-consuming. A natural next step, if time and data allowed, would be to build that panel dataset and link these stock patterns more directly to company-level financial data, so we could compare streaming and theatrical revenues and see how the movie industry responds to COVID and AI.
