# Introduction
We chose to examine the movie industry because it’s one of the examples of how COVID reshaped a major part of everyday life. Since COVID, theater closures, shifting release strategies, and the rise of streaming all created a period of uncertainty. This uncertainty affected everything from how many movies were released to how well different companies performed. 

In this project, we explore these changes by looking at both box-office trends and the stock performance of theaters, studios, and streaming platforms, and by comparing the movie industry to other sectors of the market. Our goal is to give readers a sense of how the industry evolved before, during, and after the pandemic, and to highlight the broader forces—technological, cultural, and economic—that continue to influence how audiences watch movies today.
